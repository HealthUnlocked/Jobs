# DevOps

##Job Description

We're a kickass team with a company culture to match! We're looking to grow our numbers and are now looking for a DevOps to help manage, automate and develop for our growing server fleet.

We're **not** looking for a [BOFH](http://resguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/chuck-norris-vs-the-users-bofh.jpg), a “[Wall of Confusion](http://dev2ops.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/WallOfConfusion.png)” but a person who wants to make a big difference in a small organization and build a strong resilient platform with jaw dropping uptime.
