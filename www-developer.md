## About us

HealthUnlocked is the UK's fastest-growing social network for health. With over 200 condition-specific and wellness communities, we work with the NHS and patient organizations to bring our members the best support and tools for health-understanding and assistance.
We're experiencing an exponential growth in traffic and are on the cusp of moving from being the largest social network for health in the UK to global dominance and the World's number one destination.
We're not saving seal pups or racing unicorns but 94% of our users say that we have changed their lives for the better!
We have a kickass team with a company culture to match and we're looking to grow our numbers with an experienced Web Developer to help build upon a variety of technologies.
